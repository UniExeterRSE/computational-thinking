We are now going to put together everything we know to design a software model of a popular English language word game.

### Understanding the game

#### Equipment
The equipment includes sixteen letter cubes, a shaker-tray and a timer.

#### Object
The object is to list, within the time limit, as many correct words as possible. Words are formed from the assortment of letters arranged in the cube tray.

### Rules
Words are formed by the use of adjoining letters. Letters must join in the proper sequence to spell a word. They may join horizontally, vertically or diagonally, to the left, right or up and down. But no one letter cube may be used more than once within a single word.

You might prefer to design your software in a visual style, perhaps as flow charts, or you could write pseudo-code, or an outline in a coding language such as R or Python.

The aim is not to create a working program, but rather to express the key design decisions in a way that can be discussed and shared.
