## What is computational thinking?

## Algorithms

1. Reproducibility - a standardized process ensures the same steps on every execution
2. Efficiency - identify repetitive processes and optimize, remove unnecessary steps
3. Scalability - a clearly defined process can be extended to run on larger datasets
4. Sharable - efficient way to share a process with others
5. Automation - once a repeatable solution has be defined it can be automated


## Decomposition

Break the problem into smaller parts - sub-problems


## Pattern recognition

Look for opportunities to repeat, or re-use, existing fragments
