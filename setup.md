## Pre-workshop Instructions:

It is recommended that you bring a laptop to both sessions. If you have access to a terminal or console (either via Rstudio, Python, Terminal(Mac), Git Bash, command prompt (windows)) that might be helpful but not critical. There are no pre-requisites in terms of prior knowledge or programming language, the workshop has been designed to be agnostic of any specific language.
