## What is computational thinking?

When we programme we write a series of commands in a language that our computer understands. We use a combination of functions and syntax to instruct the computer to enact a series of commands. When you sit down to programme there is an assumption that you already know:

i) what you want the computer to do
ii) how it should do it.

This part, the design of what the programme/code does is where computational thinking comes in.

Computational thinking allows us to take a complex problem, understand what the problem is and develop possible solutions that we can instruct a computer to implement. It is implicit that a human also needs to understand the solution, as they are likely to be the one instructing the computer.

Thinking computationally differs from programming in that programming tells a computer what to do and how to do it. Computational thinking enables you to work out exactly what to tell the computer to do. These are two separate skills and two separate tasks. Theoretically, you need to be able to perform "computational thinking" before you can start to code. Often we focus on learning a programming language and we don't appreciate that we also need to learn how to solve computational problems. Sometimes this is included/covered in an introductory programming workshop, but where it is, it is often not explicit. 

For some simple tasks we can solve and implemeent the problem simulatenously, there is no harm in not separately the tasks. For some people computational thinking comes naturally, and they can solve an dimplement more complicated tasks on the fly. However, for most there comes a point when this approach becomes problematic.

The consequence of not separating out these two skills is that you don't realise that when you sit down to write a new piece of code, you are simultaneously doing both. You can' write any code until you know what you want that code to do. This means that when you inevitably hit upon a bug or error in your code, it is hard to distill what is a problem with the code (wrong syntax for example) and what is a problem with the solution you are trying to implement. Remember, the computer will always do exactly as you ask. If it is not behavior as your predicted or desired, you are probably not asking it to do the right thing.

The purpose of this workshop is to step back from coding and focus on how to design computational solutions. We will cover some fundamental concepts and techniques related to designing computer programmes. Our intention is to encourage you to code with more forethought, and be able to delineate which errors relate to the construction of the code and which errors relate to the construction of the solution. In this way you should become a more effective coder and trouble shooter.
