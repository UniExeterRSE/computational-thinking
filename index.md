## Overview

Being an effective programmer is not just about writing code, it's about designing solutions to problems in a way that a computer would understand, i.e. designing and implementing algorithms. However, most introductory courses focus exclusively on the implementing, ignoring the design elements. Over two sessions, this course will introduce you to some fundamental principles that are the basis of writing computer code in any language and should enable you to write, develop and debug your code more effectively. This course is aimed at anyone who is currently programming or thinking about learning to programme.

## Course objectives

This course will covering the following:

- what an algorithm is and the role it plays in coding.
- a number of computational thinking approaches and concepts for developing algorithms.
- how to differentiate between bugs related to syntax from those related to the underlying algorithm to facilitate more effective troubleshooting.


## Pre-requisite knowledge

There is no pre-requisite knowledge and the workshop is designed to be appropriate for anyone interested in any programming language.

## Workshop format

This a hybrid workshop run over 2 sessions. The [schedule can be found here](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/computational-thinking/schedule.html).
